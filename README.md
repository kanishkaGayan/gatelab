# 🧪 GateLab

**GateLab** is an interactive web app to learn and visualize **digital logic gates**.  
Experiment with inputs, see real-time outputs on glowing LEDs, and watch truth tables generate automatically.  
Built with **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and SweetAlert**.

---

## ✨ Features
- Explore **7 logic gates**: OR, AND, NOT, XOR, NAND, NOR, XNOR
- **Interactive inputs** → toggle between `0` and `1`
- **LED output** that glows when the output is `1`
- **Auto-generated truth table** built as you interact
- **SVG-based gate visualizations** with clean animations
- Smooth **CSS transitions** for signals and LEDs
- Lightweight — runs in any modern browser

---

## 🚀 Demo
1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Select a gate (e.g., **AND Gate**).
3. Toggle input buttons → watch the LED and truth table update.
4. Click **Back** to return to the main menu.
